## Versions working:
- 1.16_combat-6 (8c)
- 1.16_combat-4 (8a)
## intermediary .json's for using as customized intermediary with original meta server (so you have new versions):
- [c-6](http://ctsmeta.latteru.ru/net.fabricmc.intermediary/1.16_combat-6.json)
- [c-4](http://ctsmeta.latteru.ru/net.fabricmc.intermediary/1.16_combat-4.json)
## Updates
This repository is, well, for one version and doesn't really requires updating, BUT, since this metaserver is being used not only for CTS, but also as global server, still I have to update it whenever new version of Minecraft comes out. I can forget about it, sorry. DM me on Discord (@808kickdistortion) if I forgot and you need a new version.
### note: i have installed auto pull system so it might work if it doesnt sorry.
